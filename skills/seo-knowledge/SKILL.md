# Client Knowledge & Data Cache

This is the system's long-term memory about each client. It persists across **new
sessions and model switches** — unlike Anthropic's prompt cache, which is ephemeral and
model-scoped. Any model, any session, reads the same client knowledge to start informed.

**Where it lives (owner-only, never in the repo):** `~/.config/claude-seo/clients/<slug>/`
and `~/.config/claude-seo/cache/`. Engine: `~/.claude/skills/seo/knowledge/`.

> **Why this isn't the prompt cache.** Switching Claude models invalidates the prompt
> cache (it's model-scoped, ~5-min TTL) — but that cache is a cost optimisation, not
> memory. This store is real persisted knowledge + cached data on disk, independent of
> any model. That's what lets a Haiku extraction subagent and an Opus synthesis step
> share the same understanding of the client.

## What it stores (per client)
- **profile.json** — stable business understanding: model, country of origin, target
  markets, ICPs, seed keyword themes, `is_local_business`. Seeded from Phase-0
  `business-profile.json`; merge-updated each audit.
- **facts.jsonl** — append-only learned facts, each with **evidence + confidence +
  source** (Evidence Integrity: an unsourced fact is stored as `low` confidence, never
  asserted as fact).
- **history.jsonl** — audit/score timeline, so you can show progress over time.
- **cache/** — expensive API results (DataForSEO, PSI/CrUX, fetched HTML) keyed by
  params + date, with provenance, so repeat audits don't re-pay for unchanged data.

## Commands

### `recall <domain>` — what do we know?
Run and present the briefing:
```
! python ~/.claude/skills/seo/knowledge/store.py recall <domain>
```
Use `--json` for the structured form. If nothing is stored, it says "first engagement".

### `remember <domain>` — record a fact
Tell the user the fact will be stored with its evidence and confidence, then run:
```
! python ~/.claude/skills/seo/knowledge/store.py add-fact <domain> --text "..." --evidence "..." --confidence high --source "<where it came from>"
```
**Never store an unsourced claim as `high`** — leave `--evidence` empty and it's recorded
as `low` automatically. Don't put secrets in facts.

### `history <domain>` — score/audit timeline
`recall --json` includes `history`; summarise the score trend for the user.

### `cache-stats` / `cache-purge`
```
! python ~/.claude/skills/seo/knowledge/cache.py stats
! python ~/.claude/skills/seo/knowledge/cache.py purge --older-than-days 30
```

## How the audit pipeline uses this (automatic)

1. **Phase 0 — read first.** At the start of a full audit, run `store.py recall <domain>`.
   If knowledge exists, start the business-intelligence step *from it* (don't re-derive
   from scratch); if not, it's a first engagement.
2. **Reuse cached data.** Before an expensive API pull, check the cache
   (`DataCache(provider).get_or_call(op, params, fetch, ttl_seconds=...)`). Cached data
   carries provenance and is cited as "DataForSEO/<op>, cached <date>" — still a real
   source, never a guess. An expired entry is a miss → re-fetch (no stale reads).
3. **Write back after.** Update `profile.json` with anything newly learned, append
   notable findings as facts (with evidence), and add the audit score to `history`.

## Integrity rules
- Facts and profile fields carry evidence + confidence; unsourced → `low`, flagged.
- Cached data is real API data with a citable timestamp; an expired entry is re-fetched.
- This store holds client business knowledge, **not secrets** — API keys stay in the
  credential files, never in profiles or facts.
- It's all owner-only and outside the repo; nothing here is committed.
